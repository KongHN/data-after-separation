刺激因素：来自尼姆刺激集（NimStim set）的面部表情图片（托特纳姆等人，2009 年）被用作目标刺激，一张带有复杂图案（由面部片段构成）的图像被用作掩蔽刺激。刺激和掩蔽刺激以灰度形式呈现于浅灰色背景上。刺激的大小为 3.8×4.0 度视角。观看距离约为 60 厘米。
信心度量表：对于信心评级（CR）量表，1 = 猜测，2 = 不自信，3 = 比较自信，4 = 非常自信。对于现象意识量表（PAS），参与者用 4 分制量表对刺激的可见性进行评级（即他们是否对图像有清晰的体验）。描述如下：1 = 无体验，2 = 模糊的体验，3 = 近乎清晰的体验，4 = 清晰的体验。对于支付意愿量表（PDW），参与者被要求对每个决策从四种可能的赌注中选择一种下注：1 = 20 波兰兹罗提，2 = 40 波兰兹罗提，3 = 60 波兰兹罗提，或 4 = 80 波兰兹罗提。当对正确反应下注时，他们赢得相应金额并将其加入账户。如果下注错误，他们输掉相应金额，从账户中扣除。参与者开始任务时账户中有 200 波兰兹罗提，并被告知在阶段结束时可以看到账户金额。最后，在感觉正确程度量表（FOW）条件下，参与者被要求根据对准确性的直觉感受对他们的意识进行评级。量表描述为 1 = 冷，2 = 凉，3 = 温，4 = 热。
操作变量：每次试验从屏幕中央呈现 1000 毫秒的注视十字开始，接着是目标刺激。目标刺激在屏幕上的呈现时长从 16 毫秒到 192 毫秒这 12 种可能性中随机选择（数据集中的 “难度（Difficulty）” 变量，其中难度 1 对应 192 毫秒），间隔为 16 毫秒，目标刺激呈现后立即出现掩蔽刺激，掩蔽刺激显示 200 毫秒。在每次试验中，要求参与者尽快且尽可能准确地识别目标刺激是女性还是男性的脸。参与者通过按下常规 “QWERTY” 键盘上的两个按键（左或右 “Ctrl” 键）之一来做出反应。此外，参与者被要求在做出决策之前（顺序 = SD）或之后（顺序 = DS）对他们对目标刺激的意识进行评级。为了便于做出反应，会呈现四种主观意识量表（CR、PAS、PDW 或 FOW）之一的图形表示。每个量表以 2×4 的表格形式显示，第一行是数值（1 - 4），下一行是这些量表分值的描述。参与者被要求通过按下四个按键（“↑”“↓”“←” 或 “→”）之一来表明他们的反应。
组块规模：有两个组块，每个组块有 192 次试验。
反馈：无
缺失值字段：反应的截止时间相关（可能是指因超过反应截止时间导致的数据缺失）
受试者群体：146 名雅盖隆大学的学生（77 名女性和 74 名男性）自愿参与了这项研究，以换取课程学分。所有参与者的视力均为正常或矫正后正常。参与者被随机分配到 8 种条件之一（取决于所应用的意识测量方法和任务顺序，即 4 种量表条件（CR、PAS、PDW、FOW）×2 种顺序条件（SD、DS））
反应设备：键盘
实验环境：实验室
训练：有 12 次练习试验，但未记录数据。
实验目的：在视觉识别任务的背景下比较四种主观意识测量方法：在量表使用方面的数量差异以及与任务表现的相关性。此外，研究识别任务决策对后续主观报告的影响（决策 - 评级顺序）。
主要结果：当参与者在提供识别反应之前对他们的意识进行评级时，意识评级与表现（逻辑回归斜率）之间的总体关系较弱。现象意识量表（PAS）仅在识别任务之后使用时其评级分布最为详尽，而信心评级量表（CR）在识别任务之前使用时其评级分布最为详尽。
特别说明：要求参与者尽快且尽可能准确地对刺激进行分类。
实验日期：2010 年
数据收集地点：波兰克拉科夫的雅盖隆大学

& Cleeremans, A. (2014). Different subjective awareness measures
demonstrate the influence of visual identification on perceptual
awareness ratings. Consciousness and cognition, 27, 109-120.

Stimulus: Pictures from the NimStim set of facial expressions
(Tottenham et al., 2009) were used as target stimuli and an image with
a complex pattern (constructed with fragments of faces) was used as a
mask. The stimuli and the mask were presented in greyscale on a light
grey background. The size of the stimuli was 3.8 x 4.0 degrees of
visual angle. The viewing distance was around 60 cm.

Confidence scale: For the CR scale, 1 = guessing, 2 = not confident, 3
= quite confident, and 4 = very confident. The PAS participants rated
stimulus visibility (i.e. whether they have a clear experience of an
image) with 4-point scale. The descriptions were: 1 = no experience, 2
= a vague experience, 3 = an almost clear experience, and 4 = clear
experience.  For PDW, participants were asked to wager on each
decision with one of four possible stakes: 1 = 20 PLN, 2 = 40 PLN, 3 =
60 PLN, or 4 = 80 PLN. When bet on the correct response, they gained
the amount and it was added to their account. If not, they lost the
amount, which was subtracted from their account. Participants started
the task with 200 PLN on their account and were informed that the
account would be visible at the end of the phase. Finally, in the FOW
scale condition, the participants were asked to rate their awareness
based on intuitive feeling of accuracy. The scale descriptions were
1 = cold, 2 = cool, 3 = warm, and 4 = hot.

Manipulations: Each trial began with a fixation cross, presented at
the centre of the screen for 1000 ms, and followed by the target
stimulus. The target remained on the screen for a duration randomly
chosen amongst twelve possibilities ranging from 16 to 192 ms (the
Difficulty variable in the dataset where Difficulty 1 corresponds to
192 ms) in steps of 16 ms, and was immediately followed by the mask,
which was displayed for 200 ms. On each trial, participants were asked
to identify whether a target stimulus was a female or a male face as
fast as possible and with maximal accuracy. Participants responded by
pressing one of two keys (left or right ctrl?on a regular qwerty
keyboard). In addition, participants were asked, either before (Order
= SD) or after their decision (Order = DS) to rate their awareness of
the target stimulus. To facilitate response, a graphical
representation of one of four subjective scales of awareness (CR, PAS,
PDW, or FOW) was presented. Each scale was displayed in a 2 x 4 table,
with numerical values (1?) in the first row, and descriptions of
these scale points in the lower row. Participants were asked to
indicate their response through pressing one of four keys (?? ??
?? or ??.

Block size: There were two 192 trials long blocks.

Feedback: No

NaN fields: deadline on the response

Subject population: 146 students of Jagiellonian University (77
females and 74 males) voluntarily participated in the study in
exchange for course credits. All participants had normal or
corrected-to-normal vision. Participants were randomly assigned to one
of 8 conditions (depending on applied measure of awareness and
task order, i.e. 4 scale conditions (CR, PAS, PDW, FOW) x 2 order
conditions (SD, DS)

Response device: keyboard

Experiment setting: lab

Training: There were 12 practice trials, but no data was recorder.

Experiment goal: Comparing four subjective awareness measures in the
context of a visual identification task: quantitative differences in
terms of scale use and correlation with task performance. Also, the
effect of identification task decisions on subsequent subjective
reports (decision - rating order).

Main result: The overall relationship between awareness ratings and
performance (logit regression slope) was weaker when participants
rated their awareness before providing identification responses. The
Perceptual Awareness Scale was most exhaustive (ratings distribution)
only when used after the identification task, whereas confidence
ratings were most exhaustive when used before the identification task.

Special instructions: The participants were asked to classify the
stimuli as fast as possible and with maximal accuracy.
